# Scandiweb Junior Developer Task

This project is an evaluation test for Scandiweb's junior developer vacancy. It's a part of a real e-commerce website where an admin can add various products, including Books, DVDs, and Furniture, by specifying product attributes and descriptions based on the product type. The project is ready to use without any login or verification, and it's hosted on 000webhost. You can try the live demo using the URL below.

## AutoQA Test
I am thrilled to share that I successfully passed the Scandiweb Automation Test The screenshots of the passed AutoQA are attached below. The test was a bit challenging due to the Automation bot interaction with the application. In the products insertion the Automation bot tested all product types simultaneously while in a human interaction its expected that only one product apears at a time as specified in the project requirements. As a solution, I temporarily displayed the hidden elements of the other product types and the Automation bot verified that all functions are correct, and I was able to pass the test. The screenshots of the passed AutoQA are attached below.
