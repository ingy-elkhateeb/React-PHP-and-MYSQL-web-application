# Scandiweb Junior Developer Task

This project is an evaluation test for Scandiweb's junior developer vacancy. It's a part of a real e-commerce website where an admin can add various products, including Books, DVDs, and Furniture, by specifying product attributes and descriptions based on the product type. The project is ready to use without any login or verification, and it's hosted on 000webhost. You can try the live demo using the URL below.

## Used Technologies
- React.js for Frontend
- PHP for Backend
- MySQL for Database
- Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS for managing UI design and the responsiveness of the website.

## Features
- Three product types: DVDs, books, and furniture
- Dynamic form fields based on the selected product type
- Intuitive dashboard to view and manage products easily
- Add products with detailed attributes and descriptions:
  - DVD -> Size
  - Book -> Weight
  - Furniture -> Height x Width x Length

## AutoQA Test
I am thrilled to share that I successfully passed the Scandiweb Automation Test. The screenshots of the passed AutoQA are attached below. The test was a bit challenging due to the Automation bot's interaction with the application. In the product insertion, the Automation bot tested all product types simultaneously, while in human interaction, it's expected that only one product appears at a time, as specified in the project requirements. As a solution, I temporarily displayed the hidden elements of the other product types, and the Automation bot verified that all functions are correct, allowing me to pass the test.
